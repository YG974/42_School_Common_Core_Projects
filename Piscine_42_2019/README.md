>     The Piscine (from the French word for "swimming pool") is the last phase before full admission to the 42 program. It's 4 weeks long, designed to gear you up to learn the basics of programming with peers like you. The Piscine is a chance to learn programming from scratch or dive deeper into your skillset and find out whether 42 is a good fit for you.
